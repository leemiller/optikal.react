Visualization of music notes, scales, chords, and modes, now in React. Based on the ideas presented in [Isaac Newton's 1704 book, Opticks.](http://sirisaacnewton.info/writings/opticks-by-sir-isaac-newton/)

In `PROP. VI. Prob. II.`, Newton describes a sort of mapping between the natural notes of the western music scale (i.e., A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) being positioned "in between" the colors of a rainbow. 

In Newton's system, the I-IV-V progression in the key of C (i.e., C-F-G) maps to the colors between Indigo/Violet, Orange/Yellow, and Yellow/Green, respectively. In my modified system, those notes map to the colors Red, Green, and Blue, respectively. This is so one can see a closer relationship between the primary components of the color wheel, and the most popular key and chord progression.
